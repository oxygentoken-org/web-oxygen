                <p className="mb-4">
                  A carbon credit is a tradable certificate representing the
                  reduction or removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO₂)
                  or equivalent greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. These
                  credits are created through projects that protect forests,
                  invest in renewable energy, or engage in practices that reduce
                  emissions.

                  Businesses demonstrating carbon neutrality through purchased
                  credits have better access to funding, attract ESG-conscious

                  because it's profitable, but because there are few ways to
                  monetize a healthy forest. The carbon credit market solves
                  this, but it's inaccessible to most due to high entry
                  barriers, benefiting only large investors. Greenwashing due to
                  poor oversight further reduces trust. Meanwhile, traditional

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      Multiple reports confirm a rapidly growing demand for
                      carbon credits driven by stricter environmental
                      regulations and corporate climate pledges, significantly
                      outpacing supply. According to McKinsey & Company's 2023
                      analysis, demand for voluntary carbon credits is projected
                      to grow by a factor of 15 by 2030, creating significant
                      shortages, especially in high-quality, verified credits
                      like those from forest conservation projects (REDD+). This
                      imbalance results from limited certified project
                      availability, rigorous verification processes, and
                      increasing scrutiny to avoid greenwashing.

                      A notable case study to follow is Banco de Bosques, who
                      acquired a forest available for sale in an area at high
                      risk of deforestation. They actively implement measures to
                      prevent its degradation and protect the ecosystem.
                      Additionally, like our project, they pursue the CCB label
                      (Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standard) by creating
                      local employment opportunities and promoting the regional
                      economy. Projects with the CCB label typically sell carbon
                      credits at a higher price due to their verified enhanced
                      environmental and social quality.

                      REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest
                      Degradation) is an international framework developed by
                      the United Nations to financially incentivize developing
                      countries to protect forests. Projects under REDD+
                      standards issue verified carbon credits representing
                      avoided emissions from deforestation.

                      The CCB (Climate, Community & Biodiversity) Standard is an
                      additional certification provided by Verra and other
                      certifying bodies, confirming that a project not only
                      reduces carbon emissions but also provides measurable
                      social and biodiversity benefits. Projects with the CCB
                      label typically command premium prices, as buyers value
                      the enhanced transparency, environmental impact, and
                      positive community involvement.
